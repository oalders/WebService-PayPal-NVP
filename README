NAME
    WebService::PayPal::NVP - PayPal NVP API

DESCRIPTION
    This module is the result of a desperate attempt to save instances of
    Business::PayPal::NVP. It didn't seem to work inside accessors or
    Catalyst Adaptors. Although the module worked, this was a major drawback
    for me. So I re-engineered it using the lovely Moo.

SYNTAX
        my $nvp = WebService::PayPal::NVP->new(
            user   => 'user.tld'
            pwd    => 'xxx',
            sig    => 'xxxxxxx',
            branch => 'sandbox',
        );
    
        my $res = $nvp->set_express_checkout({
            DESC              => 'Payment for something cool',
            AMT               => 25.00,
            CURRENCYCODE      => 'GBP',
            PAYMENTACTION     => 'Sale',
            RETURNURL         => "http://returnurl.tld",
            CANCELURL         => 'http//cancelurl.tld",
            LANDINGPAGE       => 'Login',
            ADDOVERRIDE       => 1,
            SHIPTONAME        => "Customer Name",
            SHIPTOSTREET      => "7 Customer Street", 
            SHIPTOSTREET2     => "", 
            SHIPTOCITY        => "Town", 
            SHIPTOZIP         => "Postcode", 
            SHIPTOEMAIL       => "customer\@example.com", 
            SHIPTOCOUNTRYCODE => 'GB',
        });
    
        if ($res->{ACK} ne 'Success') {
            say $_
              for @{$nvp->errors};
        }
